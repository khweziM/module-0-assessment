Dubai is a city located in the United Arab Emirates that is famous for having the
<br>
world's biggest skyscraper and largest shopping mall. Its no wonder many people flock to this destination
<br>
to feast their eyes upon these great feats and achievements, but what keeps people coming back year after year?
<br><br>
<h4>Hotels</h4>
Dubai is home to some of the world's grandest and most luxurious hotels, offering guests five-star experiences during their stay.
<br>
Tourists have a choice of staying in different areas of the emirate based on what it is they are after,
<br> 
which means a person could visit many times and still discover something new depending 
<br>
on where exactly they choose to lodge.

<h4>World's largest shopping mall</h4>
As mentioned earlier, Dubai is home to the world's largest mall, so it would be remiss not to 
<br>
mention the emirate's shopping facilities, which are well-known across the globe.
<br>
The malls are modern, air-conditioned and feature the latest fashions. Theres plenty to do, Where else in the world can you be skiing on real snow
<br>
one minute then riding sand dunes next? It would be impossible to try everything Dubai has to offer in a single trip,
<br>
which is why people return over and over again.
